'Currency Converter' is an web application for currency rates checking. It was created using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. The application retrieves data from an external JSON API (Fixer.io) and allows the user to choose from four options:

- first option shows the current exchange rates for EUR,
- second option allows you to select a different date and shows the exchange rates (for EUR),
- third option allows you to check the current exchange rates for other base values (other than EUR)
- fourth option allows you to convert the entered amount of one currency to another, relative on actual exchange rate.

In addition, the RWD approach (@media rules) was used to make the application display well on different screen sizes.
